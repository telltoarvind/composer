# http://docs.solanolabs.com/Setup/caching-dependencies/
# For libraries and tools (like composer), building without a cache can expose breaking changes in required components
cache:
  nocache: true
# Typical PHP application builds would have a cache configuration like:
# cache:
#   key_paths:
#     - composer.json
#     - composer.lock
#   save_paths:
#     - vendor
